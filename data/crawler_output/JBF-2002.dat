AFF: COMMENT
THANKS: THIS RESULT MIGHT BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT ALL BONDS IN THE C, CC, AND CCC CATEGORIES ARE GROUPED IN THE SAME CLASS. AS THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS HIGHER FOR THE C CATEGORY THAN FOR THE CCC BONDS, THE POPULATION OF DOWNGRADED BONDS WILL CONTAIN MORE C RATED BONDS.2THIS RESULT IS THE MATRIX EQUIVALENT OF THE HOMOGENEOUS SOLUTION OF A FIRST ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION.3THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TRANSITION MATRICES AND THE ORDINARY `COHORT' ONES IS THE MORE EFFICIENT CALCULATION OF THE DENOMINATOR, THAT IS THE SIZE OF THE GROUP THAT MIGHT MIGRATE.
