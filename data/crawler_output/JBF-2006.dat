OCTOBER 1987), HAVE A POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE SINCE ALL THE ASSOCIATED MOVEMENTS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, (I.E. THE COVARIANCES), CAN BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, MANY STRESS TESTS, AND MOST SENSITIVITY TESTS, EXAMINE THE EFFECT ON THE INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTION OF A SUDDEN CHANGE (VARIANCE) IN A SINGLE FINANCIAL VARIABLE, FOR EXAMPLE AN INTEREST RATE OR EXCHANGE RATE JUMP, IGNORING ENTIRELY THE ASSOCIATED EFFECTS (COVARIANCES) IN OTHER MARKETS, BOTH FINANCIAL AND REAL.
